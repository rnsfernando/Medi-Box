# Smart MediBox

## Project Description

The Smart MediBox is an intelligent device designed to help users manage their medication schedule efficiently. It provides timely reminders to take medications, monitors environmental conditions, and integrates with a web-based dashboard for remote management and control.

## PCB and Schematics

### Overview

This repository includes the PCB and schematic designs for the Smart MediBox, created using EasyEDA. These designs detail the hardware setup and component connections necessary to build the MediBox.

### Files Included

- `1-Schematic_Smart Medi Box.json`: The schematic design file for the Smart MediBox.
- `1-PCB_Layout copy.json`: The PCB layout design file for the Smart MediBox.

### How to Use

To view and edit the schematics and PCB designs, follow these steps:

1. **Open EasyEDA Editor:**
   - Go to the [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) website and open the online editor, or download and install the EasyEDA desktop application.

2. **Load the JSON Files:**
   - In the EasyEDA editor, navigate to the top menu and select `File` -> `Open` -> `EasyEDA...`.
   - Choose the relevant JSON file (`Smart_MediBox_Schematic.json` or `Smart_MediBox_PCB.json`) from your local storage.

3. **Edit and Save:**
   - Once the file is loaded into the EasyEDA editor, you can view, edit, and save the design as needed.
   - To save the design into a project, click on `Save As` and provide a project name to organize your files within EasyEDA.

### Additional Resources

For further information on how to work with EasyEDA, you can refer to the [EasyEDA Documentation](https://docs.easyeda.com/en/).

## Usage

1. **Setup:** Follow the steps above to open and review the schematic and PCB designs.
2. **Manufacturing:** Use the PCB design file to manufacture the PCB through a PCB fabrication service.
3. **Assembly:** Assemble the components on the PCB as per the schematic.

## Repository Contents

- `1-Schematic_Smart Medi Box.json`: Schematic design file.
- `1-PCB_Layout copy.json`: PCB layout design file.
